# Airbnb Data Analysis

## Background
You are a data scientist living in New York City. Recently, you were introduced to AirBnb by
a friend who is an active host in the Boston area. During your chat, your friend mentioned
attractive earnings from his listings, which piqued your interest. You are now trying to
explore the AirBnb market, and purchase a property to list on AirBnb. You have reasonably
large savings, but expect proportionate returns from high initial investments.

## Data
Available for analysis are two datasets - 2019 New York City AirBnb listings, as well as
2017 Boston AirBnb listings. Both datasets showcase crucial information about existing
properties including, but not limited to, price, room type and neighborhood. You may consult
with other publicly available datasets to aid your analysis, but it is not necessary.

## Your Task
Your goal is to utilize the data provided to you to determine the ideal property to purchase
for your AirBnb listing. Below are some sample questions to guide your analysis - you may
use them, or center your evaluation on different criteria.
1. Should the property be in Boston or NYC?
2. What neighborhood should the property be located in?
3. What type of property should you purchase (number of bedrooms etc.)?

Additionally, you should think about what data is missing - what additional data could help
aid your analysis, paving the way for a more definitive conclusion?

## Metrics for Evaluation
You will be asked to present your ideas on your ideal AirBnb property. We donâ€™t have any specific expectations on
presentation formats - this can be a verbal discussion, code walkthrough, showcasing of
visualizations (really up to you). Be prepared to justify your approach and assumptions.
